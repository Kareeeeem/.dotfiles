ran this to hide mounted drives in the ubuntu dock

`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock show-mounts false`

ubuntu was acting slow on startup. turns out it was the snap store. `systemd
analyze blame` showed it was busy for 5 minutes or so. so i nuked the store.
Two functions I used from this script I found

https://github.com/PagalSarthak/Remove-snap-in-ubuntu/blob/main/remove_snap.sh
```
# Function to remove Snapd service
remove_snapd() {
    echo "Stopping and disabling snapd service..."
        sudo systemctl stop snapd || true
        sudo systemctl disable snapd || true
        sudo systemctl mask snapd || true

        echo "Removing Snapd service..."
        sudo apt-get purge -y snapd || true
}


# Function to create a preference file to prevent Snap from being reinstalled
create_preference_file() {
    echo "Creating preference file to prevent Snap from being reinstalled..."
        echo "Package: snapd" | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref > /dev/null
        echo "Pin: release a=*" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref > /dev/null
        echo "Pin-Priority: -10" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref > /dev/null
}
```


addtional dependencies needed for python using pyenv

`sudo apt install zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev libffi-dev`

fix speaker auto mute whenever i plug in headphones on frontIO: run
`alsamixer`, select audio card with <F6>, navigate to and disable auto mute
After that save the settings `sudo alsactl store`
