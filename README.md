#Scripts
I need to learn how to do some shell scripting. Don't expect anything special.

##act
I hate forgetting to activate my virtualenv and having going back to my project root to do activate it. So here's a script that will find a virtualenv named *venv* or some other name you can specify and activate it from deep down in your project folder.

`source act` or `source act [env name]` or `. act` or `. act [env name]`

##monitor
Set up the secondary screen as primary left of internal for my i3 chroot.

##git-branch
Return the current git branch and status

##git-tags
Generate ctags in .git folder

##modernc
work on Modern C book exercises and projects.

##note
Note taking app written in bash

##todo
todo app written in bash

##pyproject
work on a python project (sets up tmux and venv)
