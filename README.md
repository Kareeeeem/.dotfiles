#Scripts

I need to learn how to do some shell scripting. Don't expect anything special.

##act
I hate forgetting to activate my virtualenv and having going back to my project root to do activate it. So here's a script that will find a virtualenv named *venv* or some other name you can specify and activate it from deep down in your project folder.

```source act```

```source act env```

```. act```

```. act project```
