"""
Switch between 2 most recent containers while ignoring scratchpads.

Ignoring scratchpads is implemented with a blacklist because the window::move
event provides the most authoritive information in container.scratchpad_state.

Other events will have this attribute set to 'none' but when you focus a
scratchpad it moves in the tree first and the scratchpad_state is set to
'fresh'.
